## **Millions are Billionaires**

### **The Macroeconomic Dao**

**The realization of an idea is only a matter of its relevance.**

### **Overview of the Gyber Experiment**

> **The Gyber Experiment** is an innovative initiative that combines cryptography, computer science, sociology, and economics to create a cyber-social corporation. Its primary objective is to establish a mechanism for direct socio-economic interaction among participants, allowing for the concentration of public and financial resources to realize ambitious global projects and manage them effectively.
{.is-info}
### **The Gyber Social Platform**

**GSP is a social network owned and managed by its users through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The platform provides basic social networking functionalities such as:**
* Projects managing
* Text and voice chats
* File sharing
* Video hosting


#### **Data Security**

**The platform emphasizes data security, offering multiple levels of data protection, including:**

* Client-side encryption
* Server-side encryption using the client's public key
* Voluminous data storage on the IPFS network
* Additional content pinning provided by nodes deployed within the experiment

### **Architecture and Scalability**

The platform's architecture is designed to be open and scalable, with various input and output points for data and multiple cores. Each user can contribute their own code module or feature, which can be included in a node and distributed among interested parties.

#### **Core Development**

The platform operates on a stack level, with a multilingual cross-platform pipeline cluster managed by the experiment participants. Different cores are responsible for specific layers of processes, and the development of these cores is carried out in various programming languages such as:

* TypeScrypt
* Dart
* Go
* Rust

### **Governance and Tokenomics**

**To govern the experiment, secure smart contracts based on Solidity language and the OpenZeppelin library are implemented. These contracts include:**

* Management tokens
* Utility tokens for decision-making and platform interaction

The contracts' source code is available on GitHub, and important decisions within the experiment are made through proposal and voting mechanisms of the DAO contract.

#### **Token Distribution**

* **Community Token [Gbr] :** a utility token used for platform interaction and managing the experiment and making collective decisions

**The distribution of tokens is allocated among different categories of holders, including:**

* Developers
* Experiment participants
* Large investors and funds
* The public market

A reserve fund is also created to optimize the deployment processes of the experiment.

### **Project Phases and Implementation**

The experiment follows a set of project phases, including:

1. Idea proposal and discussion
2. Accumulation of funds
3. Project implementation
4. Functioning

> Projects can have external clients who use fiat currency, special clients who enjoy discounts with Gyber tokens, and super clients who receive even greater discounts with specific project's internal tokens.
{.is-info}



### **Community Organization and Decision-Making**

The internal organization of the community is based on personal and public interests of the participants. Implementers are responsible for project implementation and ensuring its functioning, and decisions are made through voting by implementers.

**Interaction among participants occurs through discussion and private groups, with each project having its dedicated group. The experiment also incorporates different types of DAOs, including:**

* Social DAOs
* Code DAOs
* Commercial DAOs
* Economic DAOs

to facilitate decision-making and project implementation.


> The Gyber Experiment aims to create a decentralized and community-driven platform that enables effective socio-economic interaction, project implementation, and decision-making. It leverages cryptography, computer science, and blockchain technology to ensure data security, transparency, and scalability.

## About CyberSocium
### Theory 
**A New Era of Global Interaction**
> This is a document that has one purpose - to define the main features of a **CyberSocium** society.
{.is-warning}

**The time when approximately half of the planet carries in their pockets computing devices, the power of which, by several orders of magnitude, exceeds the power of all computing technology of the past century combined; It's hard not to call the era of supercomputers. But since any machine or computer is always just an extension of a person, it would be more accurate to call this time the era of super communication.**

The exclusive goal and opportunity of the society is the most effective association of its participants in the interests of the society itself. The development process of the Human social mechanism defines itself as a continuous development of relations between people, and this development, due to the scale of the participants in the global society, is an infinitely diverse development.

The information age has accelerated the processes of this development to literally cosmic speeds. And the main reason for this is that information technologies, mechanisms and systems are easily integrated into relations between members of society, accelerating, complicating and expanding these relations, thereby contributing to their development. Thus, with the development of information technology systems, we are seeing an acceleration in the blurring, first of all, of geographical, social and cultural boundaries in the global civilization, which in the future entails the erasure of financial and economic boundaries.

The methods of the past, failing today, turn out to be barbaric, requiring constant sacrifice on the part of society and the planet as a whole. The technological power of human civilization has long required sustainable and reasonable management of human wealth, resources and potential, and none of the existing socio-economic formations is able to cope with this task.
We may not survive global economic and social upheavals and we need a full-fledged, reasonable association on a planetary scale, at the same time we are in great danger of a global unification of the economy in the interests of only a certain part of society, provided that its (society) social division increases, which will entail followed by the continuation of the observed cycle, crises and upheavals, inextricably linked with the socio-economic situation of recent history.

### Structure and ethics of existing computer, network systems.  
**Opportunities for the development of global civilization.**

> The rapid development of technology, and especially electronics and computer science, already today determines the main vector of problems related to information, its safe storage and exchange. 
{.is-info}

In our time, information has long been a valuable resource that is constantly generated and moved across countless kilometers of network space. In everyday life, we all use information technology, and even those of us who are not directly related to computer science and electronics are personally involved in the process of generating a huge amount of data, which is all sorts of valuable information that is easily used for all sorts of manipulations and just as easily monetized.

The value of data, and therefore the value of control over its storage and movement, is increasingly seen as a well-known fact, at a time when hackers do not cease revealing vulnerabilities in even the most important and seemingly invulnerable systems, thereby showing that the security of even the most valuable data more wishful thinking than actual.

Blockchain partially solves this problem now, and as the industry develops and penetrates into the depths of the real sector of the economy, the absolute solution to the problem of data security will approach.
In addition to data leakage as a result of the activities of hackers and errors associated with the imperfection of equipment and code, we are dealing with a significantly different leakage; from quite reliable in terms of information security closed, corporate, information, social media environments of various kinds (social networks, instant messengers, navigators, various electronic services, etc.).

Most large IT companies consider user accounts as corporate property, and the huge data constantly generated by users as a full-fledged product of the company. And from a technical point of view, this is true, due to the fact that the accounts created by users are formed and stored on the companies' own servers. Probably 99% of the Internet content known to the broad masses is stored on closed proprietary servers that are physically protected no worse (or rather even better) than the most protected military facilities, and of course this is all maintained at the expense of network users.

**The fundamental, technical concept of the Internet is simple - it is a set of computers connected by a network.**
In reality, the Internet is people who send physical signals to each other through a computer network, which the computer converts for us into information of the type we need. Of course, not all computers on the network are real users, but without people, the Internet would not be alive, it is obvious that it is not conceivable without society, because this is the living result of the activity of society, at a real moment in time, which cannot exist without it.

From an ethical point of view, data created by users is at least their personal intellectual property and personal data, and the appropriation of these data by obsolete economic institutions, due to temporary technical circumstances, is a glaring fact, signaling the backwardness of the humanitarian development of modern society from the development of its technical. Adding here the fact that 99% of the Internet runs on open (free) software products and is fundamentally on open Linux servers, the absurdity of the capture of the Internet space by obsolete economic institutions becomes obvious.

Trade in user data in our time is already a well-established, ordinary and completely legal phenomenon. Companies are developing long user agreements (which are still almost never read) in which they take various kinds of consent from users, such as for the processing of their personal data, which gives them the legal right to appropriate the data of millions of users around the world, analyze it and trade them. And the multi-million community of real users remains excluded from managing and controlling their own data, which in the long term leads to the decomposition of the fundamental principles of freedom of personal information, security and control of personal data, freedom of society, and in every possible way slows down and oppresses the process of historical socio-economic development of society.

Obviously, from the point of view of ethics, the user is the sole owner of all rights to the content he generates, including meta data and any other types of data that he produces, not to mention the inviolability of personal correspondence, interest shown on the network and other things. Of course, many technical products that use user data provide convenient, useful and interesting functions for users, but it is obvious that all of them should be enabled and disabled at will, and the mechanism of their action should be transparent, ensure user data security and control, and this should be confirmed by open source product.

> Also a very important point is the individual flexibility and variability of services. The user must have full control over the part of the overall system that he personally uses, and the possibilities of changes made by the user must be unlimited within his personal part of the system. The individual possibilities of expanding the system must also be unlimited, the system must be expandable in all directions.
{.is-info}


The main problem of the Internet is that the means of manipulating data of various kinds, necessary for society for convenient and effective interaction, are mainly centralized and belong to traditional, closed, hierarchical, corporate structures. And this problem is more humanitarian than technical due to the fact that society first needs to deeply comprehend important socio-economic phenomena, of course including a technical one, but from the point of view of philosophy, ethics, history, sociology and economics, in order to form a fairly holistic humanitarian a system that meets modern requirements, capable of becoming the basis for the technical implementation of open, decentralized, information, socio-economic systems belonging to all users.

> The development of a humanitarian theory describing the mechanism of the global Human organism (society) as an integral socio-economic system will set the movement to identify new directions for the formation and development of new, applied, areas of economic science.
{.is-warning}

As information technologies develop and penetrate deeper into the global socio-economic environment, their role becomes more and more important, and competition in the development and design of information products is growing.
There are attempts on the part of fairly powerful, already fully formed global corporate structures to monopolize the global software development market, but the individual characteristics of the IT field, such as general accessibility, breadth and depth, speed of development and evolution, make this almost impossible, unlike other sectors of the economy.

The history of software development as an independently developing applied area, although not so great, however, the development of this area has already passed a certain, not a small path of evolutionary transformation.
Computer science began its development as a closed area of technology, accessible only to corporations and governments. Computers were costly, bulky machines available mainly from large technical institutions and corporations. We can roughly define this stage as the initial stage, followed by the stage of accelerating the development of information technology; it can be defined as the time when the computer becomes available to a larger number of developers. At this time, competition in the field of software development expanded and two main competing currents in the world of software development were identified.

This is followed by a certain stage of formation of these two approaches and balancing their impact on the overall course of the global evolution of software and related socio-economic transformations.
As a result of overcoming these abstract stages of development, we are seeing an unprecedented surge in activity in the field of OPEN SOURCE development, improving the quality and usability of open source software products and expanding their scope and a significant increase in the number of users.
OPEN SOURCE is increasingly contributing to the emergence of revolutionary technologies. We can even observe a whole round of evolution of global socio-economic relations directly connected and fed by the global OPEN SOURCE community and its ideas, the general vector of which is the open comprehensive development of software and society as a whole.

> Another of the main, modern problems that are looming over societies is the growth of centralized control over the dissemination of ideas that are relevant to society.
{.is-warning}


Outdated economic institutions, due to their hopeless but rather powerful position, tend to quickly improve their own mechanisms for controlling and monitoring society in order to identify relevant, advanced, socially significant ideas and projects and counteract their activity before they spread in society.

Together with the fact that the vast majority of large, resource-intensive projects are initiated and financed by the same obsolete socio-economic institutions, we basically have a world that reflects exclusively the interests of these obsolete institutions and is extremely reactionary to any kind of revolutionary, fundamental changes, and therefore to the development of society generally.

At the same time, and partly as a result of this, we see the active development of decentralized technologies, which has already formed into a powerful, global distributed socio-economic movement that has already united quite a wide and educated masses of people.


In fact, we are witnessing the process of the formation of a new type of global creative intelligentsia, capable of combining their ideas and interests with other social forces into a single ideology fully aimed at the universal good and development, to become the basis for the final formation of a new, advanced creative class, able to finally step over to long overdue, global, socio-economic changes that meet sufficiently the modern requirements of global Civilization.

Today a new, global public consciousness is being formed - the main organ of social self-government of Mankind.
Although the era of “kings” with all its characteristic, rigidly centralized and hindering the education and development of society, science and technology, control mechanisms has long since passed, and today we see the rapid flourishing of culture, education, science and technology, in the historical sense, and the penetration them (due to the historically consistent social transformations that have already taken place) to almost all sectors of society, the process of decentralization of global mechanisms of economic interaction is still far from its final stage.

Decentralization of information technology is a process that has been harmoniously developing in the depths of the Internet community for a long time, periodically making itself felt by the emergence of powerful decentralized technological mechanisms that solve certain problems of society, such as BitTorrent, IRC, Bitcoin, i2P, FileCoin, IPFS and others. The fight against such decentralized technologies is practically useless and, at best, leads to a temporary difficulty in the operation of services, which subsequently leads to their modernization and stabilization of work, that is, contributes to their development.

Decentralization solves many of the existing problems of information security and ethics today, and in the future it is able to transform the vast majority of IT services into neutral, open, owned by all users, decentralized systems, which in turn will allow transforming the most complex global macro economic processes into self-governing cyber-social economic systems directly controlled by society. Of course, many technical products that use user data today provide users with convenient, useful and interesting functions, but it is obvious that they must be user-controlled, and their mechanism of action must be transparent, ensure the safety of user data, and this must be confirmed by the open source of the product.

A very important point is the flexibility and changeability of services. The user must have full control over the part of the overall system that he personally uses, and the possibilities for changes made by the user must be unlimited, at least within his personal part of the system. The possibilities of expanding the system must also be unlimited, the system must expand in all directions.
There are many such fundamental qualities of a software product, many of which are defined in the GPL and other similar documents. However, much work is required to identify and systematize the features of a cybersocial corporation in order to apply the free principle to the global economic process.
The ideas about free software, as they develop and become technologies widely used in the real sector of the economy, brought to the world ideas about free finance, which, as technologies develop and spread, open the way for new ideas of a free economy.

Development of public systems for managing economic processes.
The evolution of global socio-economic processes consists in the gradual transformation of management methods from political hegemony towards economic hegemony, from which, in turn, the movement goes towards technological hegemony. This movement is not determined by any form, it can be several forms of movement of socio-economic processes.
The relation of these forms to each other determines the existing directions of these forms. For example, it can be the withering away of political hegemony in favor of strengthening economic hegemony, that is, it can represent a kind of hereditary transfer of the functions of managing global socio-economic processes from a separate hegemon of the monarch to a more decentralized dictate of the parliament, representing the interests of broader economic forces in the social sense.

Or the combination of economic methods of management with technological ones, which naturally gives rise to and strengthens financial hegemony. There may also be other forms of interaction of global socio-economic processes.
Combinations of these various forms of socio-economic interaction can give rise to new sustainable forms, which inevitably stimulates the emergence of new types of global socio-economic systems that are increasingly decentralized, self-governing, resistant to crises and ensuring stable, progressive development of the global economy, finance, culture and social environment.

Obviously, the desire of the global socio-economic mechanism in its historical development to come to the most distributed peer-to-peer form, controlled by means of cyber-social financial mechanisms that affect the global socio-economic resource, that is, a mechanism located in the hands of the public and controlled directly by the public.

With the development of information technologies and as they penetrate into the real sector of the financial and economic space, society acquires an increasing number of levers of significant influence on the direction of global economic development.

> Technologically, the global economy is on the verge of large-scale transformations associated with the transition of society to a new level of socio-economic interaction directly using innovative decentralized cyber-social economic mechanisms.
{.is-info}

With the advent of Blockchain technology, the possibility of building decentralized financial systems has opened up, and their development really contributes to the emergence of opportunities for building global self-governing cyber-social economic structures that expand the possibilities of intellectual influence of society on the global economic process.

The recurring crisis phenomena of the modern global economy clearly signal the absence of a sufficiently decentralized tool for really reasonable management of such a complex system as a global socio-economic mechanism.
And with each larger crisis, the social organism of mankind is increasingly forced to create an instrument capable of stabilizing global economic processes and managing them in order to progressively develop society and increase social economic wealth.

Whatever happens in the world and no matter how powerful human forces influence the course of history, the organism of society invariably produces a cycle of evolutionary transformation - adaptable change. It becomes more perfect and this process takes place, first of all, not in the stands of debates, financial and economic congresses and other hypocritical places, but in the minds of people, from the beginning in isolated cases, then gaining momentum, becomes stronger in society and developing in a spiral. And of course, all this development is accompanied and approved by the emergence of revolutionary, fundamental, philosophical, legal and technical documents and products, which are various moments of a single dialectic of the development of global socio-economic relations, systematizing and developing it to the limit required for the transition to a new stage of development.

> We live in the era of **CyberSocialization** of the economy - the transition of society to a new, conscious level of global interaction, management and development. This neologism quite accurately defines the possibilities of reorganization and transformation of society into a global, highly efficient, thinking socio-economic structure endowed with a collective mind, open to us today.

## Internal functioning

### Project Implementation

To move a project into the accumulation phase, it is necessary to burn GBR tokens by 0.1% of the required amount for the implementation of the project. The transition process consists in issuing a limited number of internal tokens of a specific project, for sale at a price of 1 BUSD.

### Reputation System

Participants gain a reputation as a result of live activity in the experiment: posting and discussing projects, participating in financing and implementing projects. Reputation can also be obtained as a result of the Gyber token staking.

### Staking

Staking is a universal tool within the framework of the experiment. With its help, you can improve the reputation of participants and receive passive income. As part of the experiment, two staking options are provided:

* GyberToken = 0.00000000007% of the total income of all projects in Gyber tokens.
* Internal project tokens = 10 / [total number of tokens issued] % from the income of a specific project.

### Organization

The community is built on the basis of the personal and public interests of the participants. Participants are verified by means of an electronic signature.

### Responsibility

Each implementer is responsible to the entire community primarily by his reputation and can be excluded from the experiment for unfair treatment. Also, the implementer bears internal personal responsibility to other implementers of a particular project.

### Assets Management

Assets received from the sale of wrapped tokens are unblocked in parts or completely by a simple signature of a single or several implementers of one project, which are determined at the time of the project proposal and the release of internal tokens of a particular project.

### Order of Interaction

A discussion group is created for each project, where everyone can get in. Further, private groups with a specific description can be created within the group to discuss the project, in which participants are allowed by the implementers.

### Private Groups

The main form of organizing any work on a project within the framework of an experiment. They are used for discussion and concrete work on the implementation of the project in the circle necessary for a specific task.

## The Macroeconomic Dao

### Ecosystem

Each Dao in the ecosystem involves the implementation of a specific project, enterprise, event, decision-making, or any other public action proposed by the community of experiment participants and developers.

**Social DAOs**

> Social DAOs are used for making decisions within the community and organizing any social actions within the community. They do not concern either business ideas or external public actions.
{.is-info}

**Code DAO**

> The current state of the code of the entire platform is supported by the state of the main branch of the repository on GitHub, in order to make changes to which it is required to pass a Code Dao vote.
{.is-info}

**Commerce DAO**

> Commerce DAO is a simple implementation of the concept of crowdinvesting, where entrepreneurs and enthusiasts can offer a business idea or a real business plan for implementation at the expense of the community, in turn, investors get the opportunity to receive a share of the profits of the implemented project.
{.is-info}

**Economic DAO**

> Economic DAO is a completely new concept of organizing public financing, project management, and socio-economic interaction, which allows accumulating social, financial, and economic resources for the most effective implementation of any relevant public projects.
{.is-info}

### Practical Logic of Organization and Self-Management of Users

#### Peer-to-Peer Structure

At the first level, the system is a peer-to-peer structure of all users of the community who have equal privileges and own equal parts of a common active resource representing the aggregate, creative, and economic potential of the community.

#### Main Application Function

The main application function of the community is effective interaction with the aim of realizing the interests, projects of all users, increasing the overall active resource of the community, developing the community and users.

#### User Interaction

Using the functionality of the extensible creative platform Gyber Social, users can safely communicate, share relevant information, propose ideas and projects for implementation, and work on all stages of project implementation and management.

#### Shared Spaces

The main method of user interaction is shared spaces: news, messages, discussions of projects, which are shared thematic folders in which each user can create folders, thereby sharing news, messages, projects with the community.

#### Internal Catalogs

Internal catalogs of the main content are directly related to the subject of the main content and constitute its internal directory tree.

#### Child Directories

When the main content is added to any of the fields, a child directory is created in the root of a specific common field, and the author becomes its director (main implementer) and can appoint administrators (additional implementers), groups, access rights to it, and change them.



## The concept of socio-economic selection
### Basic Concepts

* **New Financial Community:** 
a community of people organized for effective interaction to implement ideas and projects of interest to them, at the expense of the collective capital of participants, promotion and management of them, by means of advanced information technologies and financial mechanisms.
* **Social and Investment Circle:** 
an unlimited number of members of a new type of financial community interested in the implementation of a specific idea and project.
* **Active Group (Core of Provision):** 
the optimal number of participants from the social and investment circle who want to actively participate in the implementation of a specific idea and project.
* **Coordinating Group:** 
an auxiliary administrative resource of a new type of financial community, hired for a fee from professionals, which may consist of both community members and non-community members. The main task is professional assistance, ensuring the project activities of active groups.
* **Social Relevance:** 
a project parameter directly determined by the sufficiency of the number of participants in the social and investment circle for the implementation of the project at the expense of the collective capital of participants on the principle of minimum individual participation.
* **Threshold of Social Relevance:** 
the ratio of the cost of implementing a project and the number of participants in the social and investment circle sufficient for its implementation at the expense of the collective capital of participants on the principle of minimum individual participation in financing.
* **Collective Capital:** 
the total investment ability of the participants interested in the implementation of a particular project.
* **Principle of Minimum Individual Participation (in Financing):** 
a principle in which the full cost of the project is distributed equally to all participants in financing, and the amount of individual participation in financing is determined by the minimum possible size, that is, decreases as the number of participants increases until the threshold of social relevance is passed.

### Properties of User Spaces Interaction

* **Project Space:** 
the main functional working space of the expandable creative platform, which forms projects from the ideas of the community, offers interesting projects for implementation, discusses projects, and directs intellectual work on the implementation and management of projects.
* **Idea-Project-Implementation Model:** 
the main concept of the project field, which accepts relevant ideas for collective implementation at the entrance, forms concrete, ready-to-implement projects based on them, and implements them at the expense of an actual community resource, which is formed by the ratio of the total active community resource and the number of users interested in implementing a specific project.
* **Project Financing:** 
based on the principle of minimum individual participation, which is described in detail in the community concept sheet.

### Main Content in Project Space

* **Social and Investment Circle:** 
consists of users interested in the implementation of a specific project. The circle may consist of users with different attitudes to the project, for example, an active group, a passive group, which in turn, if necessary, may have their own internal gradations.
* **Structure of Social and Investment Circle:** 
after the final formation of a specific project, is determined by the unconditional unity of its participants. The circle includes and consists exclusively of those users who are interested in the implementation of a specific project.
* **Discussion of the Project:** 
if internal contradictions arise among the participants in the social and investment circle, a separate discussion is held in a special directory within the circle, where the main contradictions are determined in order to form a unified solution for the implementation of the project that meets the interests of the overwhelming majority of participants. If this is not possible, the project can always be divided into several independent ones and identify the most relevant one for implementation on the principle of minimum individual participation.

## Сonclusion
**The Cyber Experiment is a revolutionary phenomenon in the field of socio-economic relations that has the potential to transform the way we interact and conduct economic activities, by creating a new form of socio-economic interaction that belongs to all participants, allowing them to concentrate public and financial resources for the implementation and management of even the most ambitious global projects, thereby representing an important step forward in the development of socio-economic relations, with the potential to lead to the creation of a new, more efficient and fair economic system, where technology and economics work together for the benefit of all participants, ultimately giving us a new future.**
