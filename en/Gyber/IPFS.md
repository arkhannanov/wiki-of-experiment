  }
}

function cachePopularFiles() {
  const popularFiles = Array.from(requestStats.entries())
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
    .slice(0, 10) // Cache 10 most popular files
    .map(([cid, _]) => cid);

  popularFiles.forEach(cid => {
    ipfs.files.get(cid, (err, files) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(`Error caching ${cid}: ${err}`);
