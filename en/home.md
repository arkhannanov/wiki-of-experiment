##  Structure and Reward Mechanisms

###  The general structure of the community

Gybernaty is a unique community that unites researchers and enthusiastic developers who strive to master and develop the theory of cybersociality. The main goal of the community is to bring to life a new form of socio-economic interaction known as a cybersocial corporation. This form of organization is a decentralized, autonomous, and self-governing structure where participants interact based on transparent and fair rules, ensuring efficient allocation of resources and rewards. The cybersocial corporation is a fundamental unit of the new economic model described in the theory of the cybersocium, and represents a platform for innovation and collaboration.

### Participation and interaction

Members of the Gybernaty community are actively involved in various projects and initiatives.:
- **Participate in the development of existing projects**: Contribute to various aspects of projects such as coding, testing, documentation and marketing, ensuring their successful completion.
- **Offer your own ideas for joint implementation**: Present new concepts and projects that can be reviewed and implemented by the community, contributing to continuous development and innovation.

### Participant support

One of the key tasks of the Gybernaty community is to provide participants with everything necessary for their professional and personal development, including financial needs. This is achieved by creating a large-scale ecosystem based on the Gbr community token. Gbr is an internal utility token of the DSP platform developed by the community, which plays a central role in the economy of Gybernaty, ensuring transparency and fairness in the allocation of resources.

### Ecosystem and tokens

- **Gbr Token**: An internal utility token used to reward active participants and ensure the liquidity of projects. Gbr is the main medium of exchange in the Gybernaty ecosystem, contributing to the sustainable development of the community.
- **Projects and liquidity**: All projects implemented by the community for the open market create a pool of liquidity with the Gbr token before opening trading on DEX (Decentralized Exchange). This allows active community members to receive tokens for any ongoing projects, regardless of their personal involvement in a particular project, ensuring equal opportunities for all.

### Reward mechanisms

- **Smart Contract UnitManager**: Responsible for distributing rewards on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network. The smart contract stores 60% of the entire Gbr token issue and manages the wallet addresses of participants depending on their status, ensuring transparency and security of transactions.
- **Member Statuses**:
- **Unit**: 10,000,000 Gbr
- **Dev**: 100,000,000 Gbr
- **LeadDev**: 1,000,000,000 Gbr
- **ArchDev**: 10,000,000,000 Gbr
- **Core**: Special status for key members, determined by the community, reflecting their significant contributions and leadership qualities.

### The process of receiving rewards

**Request for Remuneration**: 
A participant can request their remuneration from the UnitManager smart contract once a month, ensuring regular and predictable resource allocation.
**Status Verification**: 
The smart contract verifies the status of the participant's address, confirming his role and level of contribution to the community.
**Confirmation of Activity**: 
The smart contract refers to G-Plan, an innovative task manager developed by the community, to confirm the participant's activity.
**G-Plan**: 
Confirms the user's activity by checking his participation in tasks and their completion, confirmed by participants of a higher status. This ensures objectivity and fairness in assessing each participant's contribution.
**Payment of remuneration**: 
If the activity is confirmed, the smart contract transfers the appropriate amount of tokens to the participant's address, ensuring timely and transparent remuneration.

### Goals and principles

- **Active exchange of experience**: 
The community strives for an active exchange of experience and knowledge, creating a platform for continuous learning and professional growth. This contributes to the development of new competencies and the strengthening of the community.
- **Expansion of the field of expertise**: 
Support and development of new research and development areas that promote innovation and progress. This allows the community to stay at the forefront of technological and scientific advances.
- **Independence of participants**: 
Providing participants with everything they need, regardless of their personal involvement in specific projects, which contributes to the sustainable and equal development of the community and ensures freedom of creativity and initiative.

### Transparency and fairness

- **Transparency**: All operations for the distribution of tokens and confirmation of the activity of participants are recorded in the blockchain, ensuring full transparency and immunity to manipulation. This creates trust and resilience in the community.
- **Fairness**: Reward mechanisms are based on objective criteria and confirmation of activity, which guarantees a fair distribution of resources and rewards, supporting the motivation and involvement of participants.

**Gybernaty** creates a unique ecosystem where researchers and developers can not only implement their ideas, but also receive decent rewards for their activity and contribution. Reward mechanisms based on smart contracts and Gbr tokens ensure transparency and fairness in the allocation of resources, contributing to the sustainable development of the community. Through the active exchange of experience and the expansion of the field of expertise, Gybernaty strives to become a leading center for innovation and collaboration in the field of cybersociety and related technologies. We believe that together we can create a future where innovation and justice go hand in hand, opening up new horizons for humanity.
